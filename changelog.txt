<strong>v0.2</strong>
- Our first major update!
- Adjusted scars to fit scavenger sprites except for mangled tails - these will become mangled antlers eventually
- Finished patrols! (Mostly... seasons and stuff to do with StarClan will be finalised in a future update)
- Replaced menu art
    - Troop creation screen
    - Adoptive parents screen
    - Mentor screen
    - Queen screen (Lifegen)
- Replaced menu text and buttons
- Replaced a bunch of patrol art. Thanks to the fantastic Tax and Electro for your hard work!
- Allegiances now describe scavengers accurately
- Troops are now named "x's Troop" instead of "xClan". This should appear on every screen. If it doesn't, Mel messed up.
- Bug and error fixes:
    - Mentions of eggs in birth events (scavengers give live birth)
    - Crash when a scavenger is born with a "mangled tail" due to lack of events
    - Instances of "p_1" in patrols instead of the patrol leader's name
    - Newborn bubbles work on both dark and light mode
    - A couple of typos
