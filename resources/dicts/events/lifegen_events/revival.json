    "revival": [
        "You wake up to your Clan's awestruck stares - no cat has recovered from such a condition before. StarClan must have been watching over you.",
        "Your Clanmates gather around, whispering in disbelief, as you stand, shaking but alive. Legends will tell of the cat who walked back from the afterlife, guided by the paws of their ancestors.",
        "During the silent vigil, a gentle breeze whispers through the leaves, and your breath returns. Your Clanmates watch, wide-eyed. Whispers of StarClan's chosen ripple through the crowd, a cat blessed with another life.",
        "A faint heartbeat thrums beneath your fur. One of your friends, who had been mourning, notices you stir and rejoices. You open your eyes to a world that had let you go, now welcoming back a cat touched by the stars.",
        "Everyone seemed to have given up and accepted your death. But when you rise one morning, acting as if nothing had ever happened, the shock and confusion of the Clan quickly turns to suspicion.",
        "You were blessed with an extra life that not many have a chance to live - chance to live out your destiny.",
        "When you miraculously revive, many cats whisper of another cat who's done it before. They call you Heavystep the Second, and elders will tell of your tale for many moons to come."
