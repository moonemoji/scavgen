You quietly growl at v_c telling them that they're a coward and that they'd *never* put their paw inside of this hole. v_c storms over and digs their paw in, where they're bitten by a snake.

Whilst out, exploring whilst the apprentice teaches you all about the cool areas, you see them slip off of a cliff, barely hanging on. v_c tells you to go get help, but instead you decide to prove how strong you are, and bite their paws until they fall off. Who's gonna be the better warrior now?",
    "You notice v_c looking extremely tired and worn out, barely responding to their peers. Seizing the opportunity, you bring them a piece of crow-food to try and 'cheer them up'. The half-awake apprentice doesn't notice the off stench and vile taste until it's far too late...",

While they're busy doing something, you tug on their tail, and as soon as they turn to scold you, you run out of camp. You turn around after running for a little bit, and stick your tongue out at them. As they start to scold you, they hear something coming, and stand over your small body to protect you. You realize once their dead body collapses slightly on top of yours, that maybe the prank wasn't so harmless after all.",

You ask them if they can take you around to see some of the nearby spots to find herbs. v_c hesitantly agrees, telling you to not leave their side unless they say so. You nod your head, and they sneak you out of camp. As v_c shows you a patch of marigolds, a hawk swoops down and takes them. You stand there in shock for a while.

They're stuck in the medicine den for a few days afterwards, eventually dying from eating what the medicine cat determines to be foxglove.",
    "You tell v_c that you spotted a cool new plant growing in a dark corner of camp that they might want. v_c happily accompanies you to go inspect it, and ducks under a ledge to get a better look. You climb up on the ledge and start jumping around and playing on it, only for it to suddenly fall under your paws! You climb out of the rubble with a few minor scratches, but v_c never comes back out..."

The realization dawns upon you as you stare at their lifeless body - your innocent game turned deadly.",

You yell at them in the middle of camp, and as soon as you're finished, you bolt out of camp, v_c following close behind you. You've finally gotten a reaction from v_c! But just as soon as you start to laugh and boast about your victory, a large dog comes hurtling towards you. v_c grabs you and throws you towards the closest bush, and you hide in it as you watch v_c lose their life over a petty quarrel.",
    "Something bothers you about v_c. Perhaps it's their ability to somehow always be right in their mediation, or maybe it's envy. You tell v_c that you had a fight with your friend, who ran out of camp in anger and won't come back, despite the stormy weather. v_c rushes out of camp in a hurry to make sure that no kit would drown or freeze in the rain, and they never return.",
    "You race up to v_c, squealing that a group of bloodthirsty o_cClan warriors just kidnapped one of your denmates, and since they're the only one that knows the other clan territories, they need to save them right now! Needless to say, the rival warriors of o_cClan aren't too keen on v_c's accusations ... though when the apprentice's cold body appears on the border the next day, no one knows where they could've gotten that ridiculous idea.",
    "You insist to v_c that their mentor is waiting for them in o_cClan's camp for a routine check-in. Knowing o_cClan isn't keen on trespassers, v_c is reluctant to believe you ... until you bring up that they're already running late, and they don't want to keep a whole clan waiting. You don't know exactly what the warriors of o_cClan did to the apprentice, but regardless, you never see them again.",
    "You tell v_c that the mediator from o_cClan just dropped off some herbs to help with their running nose, a gift from their clan to yours. v_c happily laps up the flowers ... which, little do they know, is water hemlock. They die just hours later."

As you get closer to it, you hear v_c calling out for you and running in your direction. v_c gets there right in time, throwing you out of the way and getting bit by the snake instead of you. You don't have much time to process what happened, as you hear other warriors coming towards you and v_c. v_c's vigil is held that night.",
    "Wanting to take the path of a medicine cat, you decide to help v_c yourself with their horrible stomach ache they are having. Since the medicine cat is away, you enter their den and grab some 'juniper berries', putting them inside a leaf and delivering them to v_c. They praise you and thank you saying that you are going to make a fine medicine cat as they eat the berries. As your eyes glimmer with hope for your future, the warrior collapses to the ground. That is when you realized you mixed up deathberries and juniper berries...How could you have mixed up medicine and deathberries? You can't help but run away, with tears in your eyes, knowing that you will never be a medicine cat after accidentally killing someone.",
    "As a tiny kitten, you couldn't do much and leave the camp, even with supervision. v_c made sure of this, but you wanna explore as much as possible before any of the other kits in the nursery so you can brag about your adventures. So, as v_c's attention was seen elsewhere, you've wriggle away from their sight outside of the camp and wonder for a bit until you come across a bush blanketed with bright berries, and immediately thought of a silly game to play when the alarming cries from v_c reach your ears. Stuffing your maw full of the berries, you've pretended to gag and tumble across the grass, wanting to give a little laugh and scare to your caregiver. However, as soon as v_c panics and tries to hold you down, a group of Clanmates spot the ordeal and were petrified at the sight, accusing v_c of a heinous act of attempted murder. The skirmish was quick and v_c's body was left covered with scars and hatred. You were left shunned at the sight. You were only playing.",
    "As a young kit, the world outside is dangerous and the queens never let their kits go out of camp. There was a snake that was near the camp exit. You called v_c to toss the snake out of camp but it was too late. v_c's body was bit by the venomous snake, and v_c succumbed to the snake's venom."

Your attempt at humor results in a tragedy you never intended.",
    "While exploring the medicine den, you find a strange herb that v_c always hides from the kits. Driven by curiosity and mischief, you mix it with their meal. You didn't mean any harm but when v_c collapses later that day, a pang of guilt hits you. Your prank had a far darker outcome than you intended.",
    "You make a gift for v_c, putting a bunch of the pretty flowers they have on their shelf into a piece of prey. It's a little bit of a gift, and a bit of a prank, and you're happy to give it to them! They accept gratefully, and you leave the den, unaware that some of the pretty flowers you put in v_c's food were poisonous.",

The snake turned out to be venomous."

You excitedly agree, and give it to v_c, who seems shocked and grateful. What you didn't tell v_c was that the scary cat had told you to put two herbs into the prey to make it taste better... But the herbs only ended up killing them.",
    "Why does v_c have to always be right? They've sorted out so many arguments, sure, but it's getting annoying to be told no. You tell v_c that you had a fight with your friend about who was the stronger kit, and they decided to prove it by swimming in the river by themself. v_c rushes out of camp to find the lost kit, and nobody bats an eye toward you when their soaked, drowned body is returned to camp the next day.",
    "v_c takes you aside after you start an argument with someone else, gently trying to reassure you and insist that this isn't worth starting a fight over. You want to be an apprentice, it's not fair! You'll show them all that you're ready to be an apprentice, running out into the territory. v_c chases after you, calling your name, but you don't stop... not until you run out into the road. It's a blur after that, but you're soon on the other side, and v_c is dead before you. Maybe, if they didn't want to be dead, they should've made you an apprentice.",

    "You were told by the older cats to not play out in the clearing as a dangerous bird was spotted not long ago hovering around. You, and mostly you, were told to settle inside the safety and cool nursery den, but with a kit with a bounce in their steps, you needed the space from the stuffy den. Escaping the sight from the older cats, you tumble outside and frolic in the clearing of the camp, your ears not perking at the shrieking of the bird spotting their meal and the spitting yowls from v_c to grab your attention. When you finally notice the danger you were in, the bird already dives down. However, with v_c more impressive size, instead of twisting your flinging body into its talon, the avian decides to grip the tearful v_c and swoop out of camp with them. The only thing left in the clearing was you, a few floating feathers, and a splatter of blood.",
    "You drop hints to v_c that l_n hasn't been impressed by their performance lately, and what better way for them to prove their worth than with a solo border patrol? Needless to say, when they encounter the huge dog you heard the hunting patrol mention earlier, they aren't too happy. When their body is dragged back to camp, they're barely recognizable."

When v_c's body is found hours later, the whole Clan scrambles to find the culprit, but nobody thinks to point a paw toward an innocent little kitten like yourself.",
    "You're sick of being cooped up in the nursery, so when the medicine cat gives in to your nagging and gives you an herb bundle to give to the leader, of course you accept. Herbs are bitter and gross, you remember, so when the medicine cat isn't looking, you search for something to make the gross herbs taste a little better. You see honey, and you almost grab some before something absolutely delicious-looking catches your eye - shiny red berries. Excitedly, you scoop a bunch of them inside the herb package, a bright grin on your face. You make your way to v_c's den, placing the herb bundle in front of them and explaining that it's from the medicine cat. The leader mews a thank you, but you're not even able to leave the den before you hear v_c start gasping for air. You turn around, panicking, and watch the leader fall to the ground, trembling. You're horrified and are pushed to the side as the medicine cat rushes in. Once they realize that they are too late, the medicine cat turns on you, hissing and growling. You flatten your ears against your head and slowly walk backwards, your tail tucked between your back legs. You don't even know what you've done wrong.",
    "No one would ever suspect that you, a kit, could be capable of laying a hair on the mighty leader of c_nClan's back. When their limp body falls before your little paws, you hope that no one ever makes the mistake of underestimating you again."

As you explore the new scents and sights around you, you stumble upon a patch of what you assume to be some type of tasty berry! You rush over to v_c to tell them about it, asking if they could pick some to bring back to camp. v_c happily agrees; however, it's only when they fall to the ground, seizing with berry juice covering their jaws, do you realize how dangerous the world really is.",
    "Doesn't good old v_c want to play with you anymore? It's just funny! They were always happy to see you, why are they pretending to be weak now and whining all the time, as if just to keep you behind? You only wanted to play! Therefore, one evening you finally managed to sneak into the elders den, playing with the funny v_c until late at night! They don't talk much but they do pretend to be a menacing badger for your game. Oddly, they fall into a deep slumber right after you 'defeat' them.

You finally relent and tell v_c that you'll teach them later today, but they have to make sure they don't tell anyone. v_c agrees, and later that day, when no one is paying attention, you quickly sneak out of camp with v_c. You teach them the battle moves v_c so desperately wanted to learn, but not in the way they wanted.",

You generously let them hide first, and when you're done counting you don't even bother trying to find them. You head straight back to camp and crawl back into your nest, snug and cozy.

You stop your mock attack and rush over but you're too late, the body rolls into the nearby river. You stare in fear at what you've done, and dash off to camp. Cats ask where v_c is and soon their mentor asks too, you keep a straight face and answer that you have no idea where they are. They don't seem to have any reason to doubt you.

Shaken but ready to beat them, you both attack them, however, the dogs were much larger and experianced, one of the dogs grabs you and later you black out. You're unsure if you're still alive or not, but then...you hear a familiar voice. You open your eyes, pain surrounding your body, the medicine cat was there in front of you telling you that they found you and you were badly injured.

You eat it before spitting it out- screeching and accusing the medicine cat of poisoning it. v_c sighs and insists it's fine, and you slip deathberries into the remaining bundle before they eat it to prove it wasn't poisoned. You watch as they realize what's happening, and leave the den feeling smug about what you'd done.",
    "The medicine cats used to be better, back in the good ol' days. v_c just doesn't cut it. One night, you sneak into their den, ending their life quickly. Perhaps the new medicine cat will be up to par.",
    "v_c is always treating you poorly - and frankly, you like their apprentice a lot more. The younger cat would be better for the Clan anyways, so you decide to take care of the matter yourself.",
    "v_c asks you to help them sort herbs on a day while their quite busy. You slip a pawful of poppy seeds towards the cat while they're not completely looking, and watch as v_c lap them up unknowingly."

  "murder elder mediator": [
    "In your youth, mediators were the epitome of fairness and wisdom. But v_c, their new-age understanding of 'mediation' just irks you. One night, you decide to ensure the Clan retains its honor, doing what must be done. By dawn, v_c's lifeless body lays cold. Surely, this is a dispute they can't settle.",
    "The respect v_c commands as a mediator is laughable at best. They've turned the sacred position into a joke, and it makes your fur bristle with indignation. You take it upon yourself to restore the Clan's dignity. The sun rises to v_c's lifeless body. It seems there's no mediation left for them.",
    "You remember a time when the mediator's word was law, their advice sought and cherished. But v_c? They're nothing more than a yowling kit. Your claws find their mark one quiet night. Come morning, the Clan is one mediator less. Not that v_c was much of one.",
    "The Clan's reverence towards v_c baffles you. As mediator, they've shown nothing but ineptitude. Their false wisdom and showy humility are an affront to all the true mediators before them. With swift, silent action, you do what you believe is right. The next sunrise, v_c won't see. There's no peace for them to broker now.",
    "Mediators are supposed to be voices of reason, voices of peace. But v_c's sly tongue and lazy demeanor have no place in your Clan. You're an elder now, but your warrior's spirit still burns bright. Under the cover of night, you end v_c's reign. Dawn breaks, unveiling your actions. Maybe now, a true mediator will rise.",
    "Mediators were different, back in your day. It was a role that was respected, on par with medicine cats, and dare you say, the deputy. However, v_c puts that role to shame. At some point, you're convinced they took upon the role to get out of patrols. You decide to take care of them, the good old-fashioned way. v_c is found dead the next morning. Try to mediate that.",
    "Get over it? Get OVER it? v_c's poor choice of words burn a hole into your belly, and it would be uncharacteristic for you to not act on it. You're going to show v_c just how stubborn an old cat can be. You're so stubborn, in fact, that you don't release v_c's throat until you're completely and utterly sure there's no chance of them ever saying another word again."
  ],
  "murder elder deputy": [
    "You have served c_nClan faithfully for many moons, dedicated to the Warrior Code and the word of your Clan leader. But v_c as deputy? That pitiful scrap of fur? Absolutely unacceptable. That cat is not suited for this position, and you cannot even count on your four paws the amount of other cats who deserve it more. One night, you set out to 'scare' v_c into giving up their position. Unfortunately, they don't ever wake up again. Shamefully, you slump back to the elders den, unable to face the consequences of your actions.",
    "You join your Clanmates in cheering out the name of the new deputy of c_nClan, v_c. But inside, it feels like claws are tearing apart your heart and soul. YOU should have been up there, the gazes of all your Clanmates on you, and only you - the leader's second-in-command. As the days pass from the ceremony, you feel your heart grow bitter and cold, any sense of comradery fading, until finally only one choice remains - getting rid of v_c. Though you are retired, you are still a skilled fighter, and soon enough, v_c is but a memory in the minds of your Clanmates.",
    "The chosen deputy, v_c, struts around the camp with newfound arrogance, causing your old blood to boil. Jealousy gnaws at your bones like a winter chill. In the shadows of your years, your paws still remember the fight, and v_c becomes a bane you can't ignore.",
    "Watching v_c give out orders, it feels as if your past accomplishments have been forgotten. Pride and resentment coalesce in your heart, propelling you towards an unthinkable act. Once revered, you resort to strategies unbefitting of an elder, but necessary for v_c's end.",
    "Each day, the sight of v_c standing next to the leader eats away at your serenity. Your old eyes, still sharp, start seeing opportunities. A silent battle unfolds between wisdom and jealousy, the end only coming with the deputy's demise.",
    "The once cherished tales of your glory now fall on deaf ears. v_c's reign overshadows your legacy. The pain cuts deep, a wound that festers with every command v_c gives. Unseen, unheard, the resolve forms within you - the deputy must perish.",
    "The bitterness of undeserved obscurity fuels your desire for retribution. Each time v_c leads a patrol or speaks during a Clan meeting, your heart hardens. Like the oldest and most dangerous predator, you bide your time, until the moment is ripe for v_c to meet their fate."

  "murder elder leader": [
    "You've lived in this Clan for many moons, and you worry about v_c's leadership. The leaders before them led this Clan well, but making them deputy was an awful mistake- And you swore to fight for your Clan's safety, to your final breath. You might be retired, but you still have some strength left in you - the leader finds out when you rip away the rest of their lives in their sleep.",
    "You watched v_c's rise to power. It was a filthy, rotting one. This is not an act of jealousy, you vow silently as v_c bites into the tampered prey. It's an act of justice, you promise, as the rest of their lives wilt away.",
    "Time has been kinder to your mind than your body, but even that couldn't ignore the dangers v_c's leadership brought. Waiting till the moon was high, you made your way to their den, using your remaining strength to strike at them in their sleep.",
    "With the wisdom of many moons behind you, you recognize the signs of a leader leading the Clan to ruin. It pains you to take such drastic measures, but v_c's reign needs to end for the survival of the Clan. You surprise them one night, ending their rule permanently.",
    "Your days as a warrior may be behind you, but the fire of protection still burns in your heart. Seeing v_c's ill-guided decisions, you decide to take action. In the dead of the night, the leader's reign comes to an abrupt end.",
    "The leader's misguided decisions threaten the stability of your Clan. Convinced that your duty as an elder doesn't only limit to sharing stories, you decide to act. It's a quiet night when you creep into v_c's den, ensuring their tyranny ends once and for all.",
    "Your bones might ache, but the pain in your heart aches more. v_c's leadership isn't what your Clan deserves, and so, under the cover of the night, you confront them in their den. The skirmish is short-lived, bringing an end to their rule."
  ],
  "murder elder elder": [
    "Countless moons of sharing tales and space with v_c have reached a boiling point. Their ceaseless chatter wears on your last nerve. In a fit of frustration, you force them into a deep sleep from which they won't wake, their stories forever silenced.",
    "The repetitive cycle of monotonous days and sleepless nights with v_c in the elders den has become unbearable. You take matters into your own paws, nudging them to their final rest during a moonless night.",
    "The constant squabbles and disagreements with v_c have grown tiresome. Unable to tolerate it anymore, you arrange a fatal accident, leaving v_c to meet the eternal dawn.",
    "You've grown to detest the sight of v_c snoring carelessly each night in the elder's den. One night, driven by resentment, you end their restless sleep forever, leaving them in an eternal slumber.",
    "The shared memories and experiences with v_c now only serve as constant irritants. With the tranquility of night as your shield, you guide them silently to StarClan, their constant prattle silenced in the elders den.",
    "They say familiarity breeds contempt, and at this point you can confirm it. Spending days on end with v_c crowding the elders den is driving you mad. Finally, after another restless night of snoring and grunting, you smother them in their sleep, leaving their lifeless body to be found in the morning.",
    "You've known v_c for the majority of your life. Your hatred of them isn't anything new, but cats always told you that you'll grow to enjoy their company. Well, as your joints start to ache more and more by every passing moon, you realize you're not going to be growing much longer. One morning, the Clan awakes to v_c dead in their nest, and you wailing your poor heart out. It's the best performance you've ever given."
  ],
  "murder general": [
    "You've had enough of v_c, and one day you reach your boiling point. v_c's life is no more.",
    "It all happened so quickly. One moment you were arguing with v_c, the next, they lay motionless, their eyes staring blankly at the sky.",
    "The anger that courses through you is uncontrollable. Without thinking, you lash out, and when your vision clears, v_c lies lifeless.",
    "You promise v_c a view of the most beautiful sunset. They don't live to see the sunrise.",
    "Jealousy gnaws at you, watching v_c take all the praise and attention. In the shadows, you make sure they'll never steal your spotlight again.",
    "They always said curiosity killed the cat. v_c should've never followed you to that treacherous cliff.",
    "Your heart races, a mix of fear and exhilaration, as v_c's surprised gaze meets yours one last time.",
    "An intense storm provides the perfect cover. In the tumultuous rain and roaring thunder, you ensure v_c won't say another word.",
    "It was an accident. You swear to StarClan, it was an accident. But v_c's blood is on your paws and their lifeless body is on the ground in front of you."
