You've given everything, fought every battle, for them. As the darkness beckons, you surrender, knowing you've left your Clan stronger than ever.",

As you breathe your last, a sense of tranquility washes over you. You've fulfilled your duties and more. You've left a legacy that will echo through the generations."
